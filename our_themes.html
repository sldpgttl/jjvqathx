		<p>You can even achieve some success when the sky is cloudless overhead.  Be honest and open - point out to the person where quicksands await him, and where wild animals lurk.  I once worked with a group of people from twenty different organizations,engaged in the production of household appliances.  The functions of a state body and its competence are not identical concepts.  If the weather is good, they feel good. </p>

Likewise, the strengths and some of the tools of each of the first three generations of time management provide the building blocks for the fourth generation.  Monday -â€¦ nothing.  Your grandparents had a cool personality, and it is embedded in your DNA.  Obviously, this is a very ambitious goal for people,trapped in the unimportant affairs of Squares III and IV.
